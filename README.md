# Squire-Framework
#### Build Failing
A jar-able game framework written in Java.  The intention is to be jar-able and
contain useful functionality for 2D game development.  My overall goal is to
write the framework in Java and create the games with JRuby, Jython or Nashorn.

### Engine Features
* Sprite and Spritesheet handling.
* More in development (11/17/15)
